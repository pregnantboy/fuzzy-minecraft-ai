# Fuzzy Logic in Minecraft 

In recent years, the importance of programming has become increasingly apparent across all industries with our efficiencies being immensely enhanced by technology. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought about a relentlessly growing list of tasks that can be performed more capably by machines. However, it is a known fact that there is a shortage of people who are trained in computer science and leaders around the world have been stressing the need for youths to pick up the skill of programming early. The late Steve Job have said that everybody should learn to program because it teaches you how to think. Although not every job requires programming knowledge, learning this skill from young will promote computational thinking and problem-solving skills.  

This project aims to create a fun and interactive avenue for youths to learn more about the Artificial Intelligence through simplified programming of AI agents in popular video game, Minecraft. At the same time, this project studies the performance of fuzzy logic in decision making of AI in video games.
