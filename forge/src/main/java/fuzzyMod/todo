To do list
1) create mine with randomly spawning blocks
2) change destroy blocks to give the bot the farmed item
    - check how to create inventory

3) make bots attack or run away dynamically
    - attack a certain class (move to attack other house)
    - run away from a certain class (move back to safe house maybe)

    - have certain environment factors (weather, time, sun brightness, thunder strength, rain strength, etc.. affects the strength)
        fire, water, lightning
    - external mob factors (no. of enemies, strength of enemies)
    - self factors (hp, attack strength, armor)?
5) AI editor
